It was targeted at customers, to be used in websites, web applications and mobile applications. By making it freely available, it saved traffic (through compression) and offloaded the main servers, because customers didn&#39;t have to use poor self-written scripts for image resizing. We gained experience with different user cases, and the separation from the main servers enabled us to use the latest and greatest software stack.</p><h2 id="how-are-you-funded" tabindex="-1">How are you funded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-are-you-funded" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Since 2011 <a href="http://wsrv.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wsrv.nl</a> is privately funded, and used as a testbed for new techniques in resizing, recognition and processing. Operating costs of the image service are very low. To prevent conflicts of interest, we never accepted any (financial) compensation or donation since we started, and we don&#39;t affiliate. Our intent is to keep the service running for many years to come.</p><p>Try it for yourself, if you experience problems or if it doesn&#39;t meet expectations, contact us.</p><h2 id="are-there-any-limitations" tabindex="-1">Are there any limitations? <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-any-limitations" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>There is a filter on the origin domain name.

This filtering is handled by <a href="https://community.opendns.com/domaintagging/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenDNS domain tagging</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a request limit per visitor IP for uncached requests, which is 2500 images per 10 minutes, after which the IP-address will be blocked for 1 hour.</p><p>We are not a fan of filtering or limitations, but even more so, we are not a fan of being filtered.

Costs for the servers to support <a href="http://wsrv.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wsrv.nl</a> are really low, and it serves as a great testbed for new technologies.

If you want to modify compression for JPEG-images, you can do so by setting the <a href="/docs/format.html#quality"><code>&amp;q=</code></a> parameter.</p><h2 id="which-file-extensions-do-you-support" tabindex="-1">Which file-extensions do you support? <a class="header-anchor" href="#which-file-extensions-do-you-support" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We &quot;officially&quot; support JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, WebP, PDF and SVG as image input. &quot;Unofficially&quot; we&#39;re supporting all <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php#supported" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libMagick image file types</a>.</p><h2 id="do-you-support-animated-images-e-g-animated-gif" tabindex="-1">Do you support animated images?

In my experience this is positive, because the webserver has fewer requests to process, and browsers rely more on the Cache-Control settings you serve. But it may or may not suit you. Some browsers will try to validate assets every few minutes if you serve them a &quot;Last-Modified&quot; header, and that&#39;s why I would advise to disable the use of it completely.</p><p>If you want more information about the headers we serve, consider using <a href="https://redbot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REDbot.org</a> this will explain every header we serve, and why this is used.

We are open for comments about the caching policies we use. We do run complete tests on server load, bandwidth, and CPU-cycles, for each header we place.
